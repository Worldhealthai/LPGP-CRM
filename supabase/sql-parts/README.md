# SQL to paste into the Supabase SQL editor

Paste these in order. Each file is small enough that a browser paste won't cut
it short, and each one ends on a statement boundary, so a part is never half a
statement.

## Why the parts exist

Pasting a big `.sql` file into a browser editor can silently truncate it. When
that happens the editor sends Postgres a statement that stops in the middle and
terminates it, and you get an error on a line that is perfectly valid in the
file — for example:

```
ERROR: 42601: syntax error at or near ";"
LINE 100: fund_size_usd numeric,;
```

`schema.sql` line 100 really is `fund_size_usd   numeric,` with no semicolon.
Nothing is wrong with the file; the paste just ended there. Smaller parts avoid
the problem entirely.

## Order

1. **`1-schema/schema_01_of_08.sql` … `schema_08_of_08.sql`** — every table,
   type, index, policy and trigger. This is the whole database. Required.
2. **`2-seed/seed_01_of_12.sql` … `seed_12_of_12.sql`** — sample firms,
   contacts, funds, commitments and service relationships. Optional: skip it if
   you're importing your own data.

Run one file, wait for "Success", run the next. If a part errors, fix that
before moving on — later parts build on earlier ones.

## Safe to re-run

Every part is idempotent (`create table if not exists`, `on conflict do
nothing`, and so on). Running the whole set again changes nothing, so if you
lose track of where you were, start over from part 1.

## Sizes

| Set | Parts | Largest part |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `1-schema` | 8 | 3.6 KB |
| `2-seed` | 12 | 8.1 KB |

The schema parts are deliberately under 4 KB. The seed parts can't go that low —
a single `insert` of a dozen firms is bigger than that, and splitting inside one
would be exactly the bug these files exist to avoid.

## Regenerating

`tools/split_sql.py` produces these from `schema.sql` and the `seed*.sql` files:

```sh
python3 tools/split_sql.py schema.sql sql-parts/1-schema schema --max-bytes=3500

cat seed.sql seed_companies_2.sql seed_companies_3.sql \
    seed_contacts_2.sql seed_contacts_3.sql seed_funds.sql \
    seed_commitments.sql seed_service_relationships.sql > /tmp/seed_only.sql
python3 tools/split_sql.py /tmp/seed_only.sql sql-parts/2-seed seed --max-bytes=8000
```

It only cuts on real statement boundaries — its scanner knows about quoted
strings, dollar-quoted blocks (`$$ ... $$`) and both comment forms, so a
semicolon inside any of those is not treated as the end of a statement.

It also folds typographic punctuation (em dash, ellipsis, arrow) down to ASCII
**inside comments only**. Non-ASCII inside a string literal is data — the `£` in
a cheque-size range, the `€` in a fund name — and is left untouched.
